# Intermediate Importing Data in Python

### Importing flat files from the web: your turn!
* Import the function urlretrieve from the subpackage urllib.request.
* Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
* Use the function urlretrieve() to save the file locally as 'winequality-red.csv'.
* Execute the remaining code to load 'winequality-red.csv' in a pandas DataFrame and to print its head to the shell.

```python
# Import package
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())
```
