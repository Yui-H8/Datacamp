# Intermediate Importing Data in Python
---
## 1 Importing data from the Internet
---
### Importing flat files from the web: your turn!
* Import the function urlretrieve from the subpackage urllib.request.
* Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
* Use the function urlretrieve() to save the file locally as 'winequality-red.csv'.
* Execute the remaining code to load 'winequality-red.csv' in a pandas DataFrame and to print its head to the shell.

```python
# Import package
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())
```
### Opening and reading flat files from the web
* Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
* Read file into a DataFrame df using pd.read_csv(), recalling that the separator in the file is ';'.
* Print the head of the DataFrame df.
* Execute the rest of the code to plot histogram of the first feature in the DataFrame df.
```python
# Import packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Read file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep = ';')

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Plot first column of df
df.iloc[:, 0].hist()
plt.xlabel('fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()
```
### Importing non-flat files from the web
* Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
* Read the file in url into a dictionary xls using pd.read_excel() recalling that, in order to import all sheets you need to pass None to the argument sheet_name.
* Print the names of the sheets in the Excel spreadsheet; these will be the keys of the dictionary xls.
* Print the head of the first sheet using the sheet name, not the index of the sheet! The sheet name is '1700'
```python
# Import package
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/course/importing_data_into_r/latitude.xls'

# Read in all sheets of Excel file: xls
xls = pd.read_excel(url, sheet_name = None)

# Print the sheetnames to the shell
print(xls.keys())

# Print the head of the first sheet (using its name, NOT its index)
print(xls['1700'].head())
```
### Performing HTTP requests in Python using urllib
* Import the functions urlopen and Request from the subpackage urllib.request.
* Package the request to the url "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2" using the function Request() and assign it to request.
* Send the request and catch the response in the variable response with the function urlopen().
* Run the rest of the code to see the datatype of response and to close the connection!
```python
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2"

# This packages the request: request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response
response = urlopen(request)

# Print the datatype of response
print(type(response))

# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()
```
### Printing HTTP request results in Python using urllib
* Send the request and catch the response in the variable response with the function urlopen(), as in the previous exercise.
* Extract the response using the read() method and store the result in the variable html.
* Print the string html.
* Hit submit to perform all of the above and to close the response: be tidy!
```python
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2"

# This packages the request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response
response = urlopen(request)

# Extract the response: html
html = response.read()

# Print the html
print(html)

# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()
```
### Performing HTTP requests in Python using requests
* Import the package requests.
* Assign the URL of interest to the variable url.
* Package the request to the URL, send the request and catch the response with a single function requests.get(), assigning the response to the variable r.
* Use the text attribute of the object r to return the HTML of the webpage as a string; store the result in a variable text.
* Hit submit to print the HTML of the webpage.
```python
# Import package
import requests

# Specify the url: url
url = "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation"

# Packages the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response: text
text = r.text

# Print the html
print(text)
```
### Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup
* Import the function BeautifulSoup from the package bs4.
* Assign the URL of interest to the variable url.
* Package the request to the URL, send the request and catch the response with a single function requests.get(), assigning the response to the variable r.
* Use the text attribute of the object r to return the HTML of the webpage as a string; store the result in a variable html_doc.
* Create a BeautifulSoup object soup from the resulting HTML using the function BeautifulSoup().
* Use the method prettify() on soup and assign the result to pretty_soup.
* Hit submit to print to prettified HTML to your shell!
```python
# Import packages
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Specify url: url
url = 'https://www.python.org/~guido/'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extracts the response as html: html_doc
html_doc = r.text

# Create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML: soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)

# Prettify the BeautifulSoup object: pretty_soup
pretty_soup = soup.prettify()

# Print the response
print(pretty_soup)
```
### Turning a webpage into data using BeautifulSoup: getting the text
* In the sample code, the HTML response object html_doc has already been created: your first task is to Soupify it using the function BeautifulSoup() and to assign the resulting soup to the variable soup.
* Extract the title from the HTML soup soup using the attribute title and assign the result to guido_title.
* Print the title of Guido's webpage to the shell using the print() function.
* Extract the text from the HTML soup soup using the method get_text() and assign to guido_text.
* Hit submit to print the text from Guido's webpage to the shell.
```python
# Import packages
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Specify url: url
url = 'https://www.python.org/~guido/'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response as html: html_doc
html_doc = r.text

# Create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML: soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)

# Get the title of Guido's webpage: guido_title
guido_title = soup.title

# Print the title of Guido's webpage to the shell
print(guido_title)

# Get Guido's text: guido_text
guido_text = soup.get_text()

# Print Guido's text to the shell
print(guido_text)
```
### Turning a webpage into data using BeautifulSoup: getting the hyperlinks
* Use the method find_all() to find all hyperlinks in soup, remembering that hyperlinks are defined by the HTML tag <a> but passed to find_all() without angle brackets; store the result in the variable a_tags.
* The variable a_tags is a results set: your job now is to enumerate over it, using a for loop and to print the actual URLs of the hyperlinks; to do this, for every element link in a_tags, you want to print() link.get('href').
```python
# Import packages
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Specify url
url = 'https://www.python.org/~guido/'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extracts the response as html: html_doc
html_doc = r.text

# create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML: soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)

# Print the title of Guido's webpage
print(soup.title)

# Find all 'a' tags (which define hyperlinks): a_tags
a_tags = soup.find_all('a')

# Print the URLs to the shell
for link in a_tags:
    
    print(link.get('href'))
```

### Loading and exploring a JSON
* Load the JSON 'a_movie.json' into the variable json_data within the context provided by the with statement. To do so, use the function json.load() within the context manager.
* Use a for loop to print all key-value pairs in the dictionary json_data. Recall that you can access a value in a dictionary using the syntax: dictionary[key].
```r
# Load JSON: json_data
with open("a_movie.json") as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file)

# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])
```
---
### API requests
* Import the requests package.
* Assign to the variable url the URL of interest in order to query 'http://www.omdbapi.com' for the data corresponding to the movie The Social Network. The query string should have two arguments: apikey=72bc447a and t=the+social+network. You can combine them as follows: apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network.
* Print the text of the response object r by using its text attribute and passing the result to the print() function.
```r
# Import requests package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Print the text of the response
print(r.text)
```
