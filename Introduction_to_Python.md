#### Your first Python code
* It's time to run your first Python code!
* Head to the code and hit the run code button to see the output.

---

* Hit the run code button to see the output of print(5 / 8).
```python
# Hit run code to see the output!
print(5 / 8)
```  

* Print the result of subtracting 5 from 5 under # Subtraction using print().
* Print the result of multiplying 3 by 5 under # Multiplication.
```python
# Addition and division
print(4 + 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Subtraction
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication
print(3 * 5)
```

#### Variable Assignment
In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name.   
To create a variable x with a value of 5, you use =, like this example:

* Create a variable savings with the value of 100.
* Check out this variable by typing print(savings) in the script.
```python
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```
* Create a variable monthly_savings, equal to 10 and num_months, equal to 4.
* Multiply monthly_savings by num_months and assign it to new_savings.
* Print the value of new_savings.
```python
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Print new_savings
print(new_savings)
```

* Create a new float, half, with the value 0.5.
* Create a new string, intro, with the value "Hello! How are you?".
* Create a new boolean, is_good, with the value True.
```python
# Create a variable half
half = 0.5

# Create a variable intro
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Create a variable is_good
is_good = True
```
1. Add savings and new_savings and assign it to total_savings. Use type() to print the resulting type of total_savings.
```python
savings = 100
new_savings = 40

# Calculate total_savings using savings and new_savings
total_savings = savings + new_savings
print(total_savings)

# Print the type of total_savings
type(total_savings)
```
