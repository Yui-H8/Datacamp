#### Variable Assignment
In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name.   
To create a variable x with a value of 5, you use =, like this example:

* Create a variable savings with the value of 100.
* Check out this variable by typing print(savings) in the script.
```python
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```
