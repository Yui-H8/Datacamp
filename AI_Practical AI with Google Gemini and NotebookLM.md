### Gemini as a partner
Maya just started as a marketing coordinator at a growing tech company called FlowTech. Her manager mentions that the team uses Gemini to boost productivity. Maya has used search engines before, but she's not sure how Gemini is different.

Her manager explains: "Think of Gemini as a creative and productive partner, not just a smarter search engine."

What makes Gemini a "partner" rather than just a search tool?
```
Gemini has access to more websites and can find obscure information faster than traditional search engines.
Gemini remembers your previous searches and personalizes results based on your history.
〇 Gemini can analyze information, write content, and reason through complex problems—not just retrieve existing answers.
Gemini uses voice input, making it more convenient than typing search queries.
```
*Exactly! Unlike search, Gemini can synthesize information, create new content, and help you reason through problems—making it a true collaborator.*

### Smart delegation to Gemini
Maya's manager explains that the key to using Gemini effectively is smart delegation: knowing which tasks to automate with Gemini (full delegation), and which ones to augment with Gemini (partial delegation that requires human judgment).

Help Maya understand how to approach different tasks by classifying them correctly.

*Great job! You've helped Maya understand smart delegation. Repetitive tasks can be automated, but high-value work needs your expertise with AI as a collaborator.*

### Your first prompt
Maya has learned that Gemini is a creative partner. Now it's time to put that into practice!

Imagine you're Maya, and you want to make a great impression in your first week. You need to send a brief email introducing yourself to your new team, but you're not sure how to strike the right tone.

This is exactly the kind of task where Gemini can help: drafting professional content quickly.
* Ask Gemini to help you write a self-introduction email to your new team. You can add relevant details like your name and role.
* Keep your prompt simple—just tell Gemini what you need.
```
Prease write self-introduction email to my new team including name and role. My name is Maya, a marketing coordinator at a growing tech company called FlowTech.

### The power of context
Imagine you've just joined FlowTech, and your manager asks you to announce the launch of their new product, FlowTrack.

You've already learned that AI output quality depends on the quality of the context you provide and the clarity of your instructions. Now, you'll put that into practice.

You'll ask Gemini to write a LinkedIn post announcing the launch of FlowTrack, a productivity app for remote team managers. To get the best results, you'll need to include key details as described in the instructions.
* Ask Gemini to write a LinkedIn post announcing the launch of FlowTrack, a productivity app.
* Include details about the tone of the post (warm and friendly), the audience (remote team managers), the product's benefits (helps teams stay aligned with shared task views and smart reminders), the timing (launching next week), and a call to action.

> Write a professional LinkedIn post announcing the launch of FlowTrack, a new productivity app for remote team managers. Highlight how it helps teams stay aligned with shared task views and smart reminders. Keep the tone upbeat and mention that it’s launching next week. End with a clear call to action inviting readers to join the waitlist.
