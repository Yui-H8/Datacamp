### Gemini as a partner
Maya just started as a marketing coordinator at a growing tech company called FlowTech. Her manager mentions that the team uses Gemini to boost productivity. Maya has used search engines before, but she's not sure how Gemini is different.

Her manager explains: "Think of Gemini as a creative and productive partner, not just a smarter search engine."

What makes Gemini a "partner" rather than just a search tool?
```
Gemini has access to more websites and can find obscure information faster than traditional search engines.
Gemini remembers your previous searches and personalizes results based on your history.
〇 Gemini can analyze information, write content, and reason through complex problems—not just retrieve existing answers.
Gemini uses voice input, making it more convenient than typing search queries.
```
*Exactly! Unlike search, Gemini can synthesize information, create new content, and help you reason through problems—making it a true collaborator.*

### Smart delegation to Gemini
Maya's manager explains that the key to using Gemini effectively is smart delegation: knowing which tasks to automate with Gemini (full delegation), and which ones to augment with Gemini (partial delegation that requires human judgment).

Help Maya understand how to approach different tasks by classifying them correctly.

*Great job! You've helped Maya understand smart delegation. Repetitive tasks can be automated, but high-value work needs your expertise with AI as a collaborator.*

### Your first prompt
Maya has learned that Gemini is a creative partner. Now it's time to put that into practice!

Imagine you're Maya, and you want to make a great impression in your first week. You need to send a brief email introducing yourself to your new team, but you're not sure how to strike the right tone.

This is exactly the kind of task where Gemini can help: drafting professional content quickly.
* Ask Gemini to help you write a self-introduction email to your new team. You can add relevant details like your name and role.
* Keep your prompt simple—just tell Gemini what you need.
```
Prease write self-introduction email to my new team including name and role. My name is Maya, a marketing coordinator at a growing tech company called FlowTech.

+100XP

Great Start! You clearly specified the task and provided relevant context about your new role and team. For even better results, consider mentioning the desired tone or any specific details you'd like to include. Your clarity is a strong point!

Nice work! You just used Gemini to draft professional content in seconds.

### The power of context
Imagine you've just joined FlowTech, and your manager asks you to announce the launch of their new product, FlowTrack.

You've already learned that AI output quality depends on the quality of the context you provide and the clarity of your instructions. Now, you'll put that into practice.

You'll ask Gemini to write a LinkedIn post announcing the launch of FlowTrack, a productivity app for remote team managers. To get the best results, you'll need to include key details as described in the instructions.
* Ask Gemini to write a LinkedIn post announcing the launch of FlowTrack, a productivity app.
* Include details about the tone of the post (warm and friendly), the audience (remote team managers), the product's benefits (helps teams stay aligned with shared task views and smart reminders), the timing (launching next week), and a call to action.

> Write a professional LinkedIn post announcing the launch of FlowTrack, a new productivity app for remote team managers. Highlight how it helps teams stay aligned with shared task views and smart reminders. Keep the tone upbeat and mention that it’s launching next week. End with a clear call to action inviting readers to join the waitlist.

```
🚀 Exciting news! We're thrilled to introduce FlowTrack, the productivity app built for remote team managers who want to keep their teams aligned and motivated. With shared task views, smart reminders, and seamless collaboration, FlowTrack helps you bring structure and clarity to every project. Launching next week — join the waitlist today and be the first to experience a new way to stay on track!
```
### Writing a structured prompt
In the previous exercise, you saw how adding context makes Gemini's output more useful. Now, you'll take it one step further by using a more structured prompt.

Imagine now your manager asks you to announce a new internal sustainability initiative called GreenFuture. You decide to pair with Gemini to write the internal memo. You'll use a structured prompt format with three key parts:
* Role: Who Gemini should act as.
* Context: What Gemini needs to know to do the task well.
* Task: What you want Gemini to produce.

This structure helps you give Gemini everything it needs to respond accurately, clearly, and in the right tone.
* Write a structured prompt for Gemini to draft an internal memo announcing FlowTech’s sustainability initiative, GreenFuture.
* Be sure to include: Gemini's role (marketing manager at a tech company), the audience (FlowTech's employees), the initiative (GreenFuture), the goal (reduce packaging waste by 40%), the task (write a concise internal memo inviting employees to share ideas), and the tone (professional and optimistic).
> You are a marketing manager at a tech company. Write a concise internal memo inviting employees to share ideas with professional and optimistic tone. To send FlowTech’s employees sustainability initiative, GreenFuture. Our goal is that reduce packaging waste by 40%.
```
Subject: Join FlowTech's GreenFuture Initiative!

Hi Team,

Exciting news! We're launching GreenFuture, a sustainability initiative to reduce packaging waste by 40%. We're inviting all employees to share innovative ideas to help us achieve this ambitious goal. Your input is crucial to our success.

Let's build a greener future together!

Best,

Well done!

Great Start, But Add Structure! You clearly specify the audience and provide strong context, especially about the initiative and its goal. However, the prompt lacks a fully structured format with explicit role, context, and task sections. Nice job on clarity and tone guidance!
```

### The Canvas workflow
Your colleague Maya loved the FlowTrack LinkedIn post you and Gemini wrote! Now she wants to create a project plan for the company's upcoming client conference using Gemini Canvas.

Maya opens Gemini and types her first prompt, along with the Canvas option checked. The output is decent, but the milestones feel generic and the timeline is unrealistic. Instead of starting over, Maya decides to iterate directly in Canvas.

Help Maya understand the iterative workflow that makes Canvas so powerful.
* Arrange the steps to show how Maya iterates on her work in Gemini Canvas.
 
*Perfect! You've mastered the Canvas workflow: prompt, review, identify, refine, repeat. This iterative approach is how you turn a "decent" first draft into something genuinely useful.*

### Refining with Canvas
