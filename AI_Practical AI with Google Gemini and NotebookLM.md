### Gemini as a partner
Maya just started as a marketing coordinator at a growing tech company called FlowTech. Her manager mentions that the team uses Gemini to boost productivity. Maya has used search engines before, but she's not sure how Gemini is different.

Her manager explains: "Think of Gemini as a creative and productive partner, not just a smarter search engine."

What makes Gemini a "partner" rather than just a search tool?
```
Gemini has access to more websites and can find obscure information faster than traditional search engines.
Gemini remembers your previous searches and personalizes results based on your history.
〇 Gemini can analyze information, write content, and reason through complex problems—not just retrieve existing answers.
Gemini uses voice input, making it more convenient than typing search queries.
```
*Exactly! Unlike search, Gemini can synthesize information, create new content, and help you reason through problems—making it a true collaborator.*

### Smart delegation to Gemini
Maya's manager explains that the key to using Gemini effectively is smart delegation: knowing which tasks to automate with Gemini (full delegation), and which ones to augment with Gemini (partial delegation that requires human judgment).

Help Maya understand how to approach different tasks by classifying them correctly.

*Great job! You've helped Maya understand smart delegation. Repetitive tasks can be automated, but high-value work needs your expertise with AI as a collaborator.*
