# Introduction to R for Finance
---
### Your first R script
* An addition example has already been created for you.
* Add another line of code in the script to calculate the difference of 6 and 4.
* Note: Check out the # symbol in the script! This denotes a comment in your code. Comments are a great way to document your code, and are not run when you submit your answer.
```r
# Addition!
3 + 5

# Subtraction!
6 - 4
```
