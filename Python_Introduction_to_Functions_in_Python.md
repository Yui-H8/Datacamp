# Introduction to Functions in Python

### Strings in Python
### Recapping built-in functions
Correct! It is important to remember that assigning a variable y2 to a function that prints a value but does not return a value will result in that variable y2 being of type NoneType.

### Write a simple function
* Complete the function header by adding the appropriate function name, shout.
* In the function body, concatenate the string, 'congratulations' with another string, '!!!'. Assign the result to shout_word.
* Print the value of shout_word.
* Call the shout function.
