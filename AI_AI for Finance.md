# AI for Finance
---

**Description**

Are you a finance professional looking to work smarter with AI? This course will show you how to use artificial intelligence to analyze financial data, uncover insights in reports and filings, and streamline everyday workflows. You will learn how to design prompts that deliver consistent results, combine narrative and numbers into clear takeaways, and set up simple automations to save hours during close cycles. By the end, you will be able to turn AI into a reliable partner for research, analysis, and reporting while boosting both your productivity and your impact in the finance organization.

### Finance meets AI
You've just joined the finance team at HarborView Capital, a growing investment advisory firm.

As part of your onboarding, your manager has asked you to explore how generative AI tools, like Microsoft Copilot, could enhance the team's day-to-day work.

Your task is to identify practical ways generative AI might support financial analysis, risk management, and operational efficiency. This research will form the foundation of a short presentation to your team later this week.
