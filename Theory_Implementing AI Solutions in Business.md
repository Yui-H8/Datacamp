# Implementing AI Solutions in Business
---
**Description**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being adopted at a faster and faster rate due to the increase in compute efficiency, decrease in compute costs, and heightened democratization of foundational models. Businesses from all industries are seeking ways to leverage AI to optimize processes, improve customer experience, and drive business value.


In this course, you'll learn how to successfully implement an AI solution for your business. You'll identify appropriate business use cases, build a proof of concept, measure success, and evaluate how to move from POC to a fully implemented solution. You'll learn how Responsible AI, security, and upskilling are equally important components.

### Do you know AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a new technology though exciting developments have emerged in recent years. The most recent form of AI is being modeled after the way we process information as humans - even how you are reading this text now! It can be used for many tasks and use cases across businesses and our lives.

Which of the following statements about AI and AI solutions are true?
```
AI is a recent (past 20 years) development in technology.
〇 AI is the development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
〇 AI can be used for image processing and classification.
An AI solution can be developed without connection to the business.
```
*Well done! AI is quite exciting in its capabilities.*

### The phases of an AI solution
A successful AI solution implementation will generally follow five broad steps from ideation to production. These steps may look similar to any other technology strategy. However, the particular details about the implementation will differ.

*Congratulations. You're on your way to a successful AI solution!*

### Still know AI?
As we have discussed, artificial intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Select the answer that best explains how AI works.
```
AI has fundamentally the same cognitive qualities and abilities as humans
AI is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of data.
〇 AI efficiently finds patterns in massive datasets, using those patterns to make decisions
AI achieves human-like intelligence by replicating the structure of the human brain.
```
*Perfect! You are starting to get the hang of AI.*

### Generative AI vs. Other AI
Artificial Intelligence has been around for decades. Generative AI - e.g., ChatGPT, DALL-E, BARD - is the most recent advancement in this space with some important differences. Some of these differences were covered, at a high level, in the previous lesson.
* Categorize the following statements as belonging to "Generative AI" or "Other AI."

*Congratulations! You're starting to understand the different types of AI and how to apply them. Now, can you remember the components of AI?*

### Components of an AI solution
A basic AI solution will have several important components that help with building the AI model and then integrating it into a product or system. Some of them will be general to technological solutions, while others are specific to meet the demands of an AI solution.

Which of the options below are part of a basic AI solution, as described in the video lesson?
> Hint   
> An AI solution will be comprised of the core model, hardware to run the model, and an environment in which the AI solution will be stored and used.
```
〇 A product or system
〇 Specialized hardware
ChatGPT
〇 AI model
```
*Congratulations! Knowing the high-level solution is half the battle to building a great AI solution. Before going into more detail, let's discuss how to remain responsible while building AI solutions.*

### Why is Responsible AI important?
Responsible AI should be at the forefront of an AI solution strategy. It acts as a governance model to ensure the solution(s) are built in a safe and ethical way. It will also help the company mitigate against legal, social, and financial repercussions.

With that said, which statements about Responsible AI are true?
```
〇 It can improve the design of the AI solution to be inclusive and accessible to more people.
It ensures the AI solution leverages the newest technology
〇 It can build trust with users, developers, and others.
〇 Responsible AI can limit the amount of unconscious bias unintentionally built into the system.
```

*Well done! A Responsible AI, when implemented correctly, can ensure the design is inclusive and accessible. Now let's see if you remember the common principles of Responsible AI.*

### Common Principles of Responsible AI
Every business will create their own principles for responsible AI depending on their values and what they believe to be important. However, there are some which appear to be common across organizations.
* Classify the options into either part of a "Responsible AI" principle or not.
