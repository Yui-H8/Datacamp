# Implementing AI Solutions in Business
---
**Description**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being adopted at a faster and faster rate due to the increase in compute efficiency, decrease in compute costs, and heightened democratization of foundational models. Businesses from all industries are seeking ways to leverage AI to optimize processes, improve customer experience, and drive business value.


In this course, you'll learn how to successfully implement an AI solution for your business. You'll identify appropriate business use cases, build a proof of concept, measure success, and evaluate how to move from POC to a fully implemented solution. You'll learn how Responsible AI, security, and upskilling are equally important components.

### Do you know AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a new technology though exciting developments have emerged in recent years. The most recent form of AI is being modeled after the way we process information as humans - even how you are reading this text now! It can be used for many tasks and use cases across businesses and our lives.

Which of the following statements about AI and AI solutions are true?
```
AI is a recent (past 20 years) development in technology.
〇 AI is the development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
〇 AI can be used for image processing and classification.
An AI solution can be developed without connection to the business.
```
*Well done! AI is quite exciting in its capabilities.*

### The phases of an AI solution
A successful AI solution implementation will generally follow five broad steps from ideation to production. These steps may look similar to any other technology strategy. However, the particular details about the implementation will differ.

*Congratulations. You're on your way to a successful AI solution!*

### Still know AI?
As we have discussed, artificial intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Select the answer that best explains how AI works.
```
AI has fundamentally the same cognitive qualities and abilities as humans
AI is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of data.
〇 AI efficiently finds patterns in massive datasets, using those patterns to make decisions
AI achieves human-like intelligence by replicating the structure of the human brain.
```
*Perfect! You are starting to get the hang of AI.*

### Generative AI vs. Other AI
Artificial Intelligence has been around for decades. Generative AI - e.g., ChatGPT, DALL-E, BARD - is the most recent advancement in this space with some important differences. Some of these differences were covered, at a high level, in the previous lesson.
