### Working with number variables
* Create a variable called account_balance with a value of 120.50.
* Print the account_balance variable.
```python
# Age of a customer
customer_age = 27

# Create account_balance variable
account_balance = 120.50

# Print account_balance
print(account_balance)
```
### Updating variable values
* Update the account_balance to be 1300000.00.
* Update the is_millionaire variable to be True.
* Print the is_millionaire variable to see its updated Boolean value.
```python
account_balance = 20000.00
is_millionaire = False

# Update account balance
account_balance = 1300000.00
# Update is_millionaire variable
is_millionaire = True

print(account_balance)
print(is_millionaire)
```
