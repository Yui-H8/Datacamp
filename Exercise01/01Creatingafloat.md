## Creating a float
Before we start looking for Bayes' kidnapper, we need to fill out a Missing Puppy Report with details of the case. Each piece of information will be stored as a variable.  

We define a variable using an equals sign (=). For instance, we would define the variable height:

```Python
# Fill in Bayes' age (4.0)
age = 4.0

# Display the variable bayes_age
print(age)
```
