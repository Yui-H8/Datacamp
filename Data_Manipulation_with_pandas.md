### Data Manipulation with pandas
---
### Inspecting a DataFrame
* Print the head of the homelessness DataFrame.
```python
# Print the head of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.head())
```
* Print information about the column types and missing values in homelessness.
```python
# Print information about homelessness
print(homelessness.info())
```
* Print the number of rows and columns in homelessness.
```python
# Print the shape of homelessness
print(homelessness.shape)
```
* Print some summary statistics that describe the homelessness DataFrame.
```python
# Print a description of homelessness
print(homelessness.describe())
```
---
### Parts of a DataFrame
* Import pandas using the alias pd.
* Print a 2D NumPy array of the values in homelessness.
* Print the column names of homelessness.
* Print the index of homelessness.
```python
# Import pandas using the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Print the values of homelessness
print(homelessness.values)

# Print the column index of homelessness
print(homelessness.columns)

# Print the row index of homelessness
print(homelessness.index)
```
---
### Sorting rows
* Sort homelessness by the number of homeless individuals in the individuals column, from smallest to largest, and save this as homelessness_ind.   
Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.
```python
# Sort homelessness by individuals
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values("individuals")

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_ind.head())
```
* Sort homelessness by the number of homeless family_members in descending order, and save this as homelessness_fam.
```python
# Sort homelessness by descending family members
homelessness_fam = homelessness.sort_values("family_members", ascending=False)

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_fam.head())
```
* Sort homelessness first by region (ascending), and then by number of family members (descending). Save this as homelessness_reg_fam.
```python
# Sort homelessness by region, then descending family members
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region","family_members"], ascending = [True, False])

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_reg_fam.head())
```
---
### Subsetting columns
1. Create a Series called individuals that contains only the individuals column of homelessness.
```python
# Select the individuals column
individuals = homelessness["individuals"]

print(individuals.head())
```
2. Create a DataFrame called state_fam that contains only the state and family_members columns of homelessness, in that order.
```python
# Select the state and family_members columns
state_fam = homelessness[["state", "family_members"]]

print(state_fam.head())
```
3. Create a DataFrame called ind_state that contains the individuals and state columns of homelessness, in that order.
```python
# Select only the individuals and state columns, in that order
ind_state = homelessness[["individuals", "state"]]

print(ind_state.head())
```
---
### Subsetting rows
1. Filter homelessness for cases where the number of individuals is greater than ten thousand, assigning to ind_gt_10k. View the printed result.
```python
# Filter for rows where individuals is greater than 10000
ind_gt_10k = [homelessness["individuals"] > 10000]

# See the result
print(ind_gt_10k)
```
2. Filter homelessness for cases where the USA Census region is "Mountain", assigning to mountain_reg. View the printed result.
```python
# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[homelessness["region"] == "Mountain"]

# See the result
print(mountain_reg)
```
3. Filter homelessness for cases where the USA Census region is "Mountain", assigning to mountain_reg. View the printed result.
```python
# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000 
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[
    (homelessness["family_members"] < 1000) &
    (homelessness["region"] == "Pacific")
]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)
```
---
### Subsetting rows by categorical variables
* Filter homelessness for cases where the USA census state is in the list of Mojave states, canu, assigning to mojave_homelessness. View the printed result.
```python
# The Mojave Desert states
canu = ["California", "Arizona", "Nevada", "Utah"]

# Filter for rows in the Mojave Desert states
mojave_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness["state"].isin(canu)]

# See the result
print(mojave_homelessness)
```
### Adding new columns
* Add a new column to homelessness, named total, containing the sum of the individuals and family_members columns.
* Add another column to homelessness, named p_homeless, containing the proportion of the total homeless population to the total population in each state state_pop.
``` python
# Add total col as sum of individuals and family_members
homelessness["total"] = homelessness["individuals"] + homelessness["family_members"]

# Add p_homeless col as proportion of total homeless population to the state population
homelessness["p_homeless"] = homelessness["total"] / homelessness["state_pop"]

# See the result
print(homelessness)
```
### Combo-attack!
ï¼ŠAdd a column to homelessness, indiv_per_10k, containing the number of homeless individuals per ten thousand people in each state, using state_pop for state population.
* Subset rows where indiv_per_10k is higher than 20, assigning to high_homelessness.
* Sort high_homelessness by descending indiv_per_10k, assigning to high_homelessness_srt.
* Select only the state and indiv_per_10k columns of high_homelessness_srt and save as result. Look at the result.
