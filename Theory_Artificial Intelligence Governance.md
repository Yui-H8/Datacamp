### Defining AI governance in practice
Your team is preparing to launch a machine learning model, and you're asked to explain AI governance to the product owner.

What is the core function of AI governance in this situation?
```
Writing the code that powers AI algorithms
Applying moral values to guide AI decisions
〇 Establishing structures and processes to ensure responsible AI development and use
```
*Correct! Governance sets up rules and responsibilities that guide responsible AI practices.*

### Distinguishing governance from ethics
You're reviewing your organization's AI policies and notice confusion between governance and ethics.

What best explains how governance differs from ethics?
```
Governance replaces the need for ethical principles
〇 Governance puts ethical principles into practice through structures and policies
Ethics determines who is accountable when an AI model fails
```
*Exactly! Governance is how ethical principles are implemented and enforced.*

### Responding to external AI pressures
You're reviewing your team's AI governance plan ahead of a regulatory audit.

Which tool is most likely to help demonstrate compliance with external AI regulations?
```
A dashboard showing customer engagement metrics
〇 A tool that logs data sources, model decisions, and ethical checks
An automated system that tunes model hyperparameters
```
*Correct! Tools that document decisions and ethical adherence are critical for regulatory compliance.*

### Who walks the talk?
You're joining the launch team for a new AI-powered lending product at TrustFair Bank. Before go-live, your team needs to distinguish between the values you're committed to and the actions you're taking to enforce them.

The Chief Risk Officer has asked you to categorize the team's recent AI initiatives into ethical principles or governance mechanisms.
* Review each initiative and classify it as either AI ethics or AI governance.

*Excellent! You've correctly identified the difference between principles and enforcement - ethics tells us what matters, and governance ensures it happens.*

### Embedding governance across the AI lifecycle
You're training new hires on how your organization applies governance to AI development.

Where should governance be applied within the AI lifecycle?
```
〇 Throughout planning, development, deployment, and monitoring
Only after the model is trained and validated
Only during risk review by compliance teams
```
*Correct! Governance begins early and continues across the AI lifecycle to ensure responsible outcomes.*

### Coordinating roles and responsibilities
Your company is launching a cross-functional AI governance committee.

Which of the following best describes the purpose of this kind of governance structure?


*Correct! Governance structures ensure oversight is shared across key departments.*
