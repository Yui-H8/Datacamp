### Defining AI governance in practice
Your team is preparing to launch a machine learning model, and you're asked to explain AI governance to the product owner.

What is the core function of AI governance in this situation?
```
Writing the code that powers AI algorithms
Applying moral values to guide AI decisions
〇 Establishing structures and processes to ensure responsible AI development and use
```
*Correct! Governance sets up rules and responsibilities that guide responsible AI practices.*

### Distinguishing governance from ethics
You're reviewing your organization's AI policies and notice confusion between governance and ethics.

What best explains how governance differs from ethics?
```
Governance replaces the need for ethical principles
〇 Governance puts ethical principles into practice through structures and policies
Ethics determines who is accountable when an AI model fails
```
*Exactly! Governance is how ethical principles are implemented and enforced.*

### Responding to external AI pressures
You're reviewing your team's AI governance plan ahead of a regulatory audit.

Which tool is most likely to help demonstrate compliance with external AI regulations?
```
A dashboard showing customer engagement metrics
〇 A tool that logs data sources, model decisions, and ethical checks
An automated system that tunes model hyperparameters
```
*Correct! Tools that document decisions and ethical adherence are critical for regulatory compliance.*

### Who walks the talk?
You're joining the launch team for a new AI-powered lending product at TrustFair Bank. Before go-live, your team needs to distinguish between the values you're committed to and the actions you're taking to enforce them.

The Chief Risk Officer has asked you to categorize the team's recent AI initiatives into ethical principles or governance mechanisms.
* Review each initiative and classify it as either AI ethics or AI governance.

*Excellent! You've correctly identified the difference between principles and enforcement - ethics tells us what matters, and governance ensures it happens.*

### Embedding governance across the AI lifecycle
You're training new hires on how your organization applies governance to AI development.

Where should governance be applied within the AI lifecycle?
```
〇 Throughout planning, development, deployment, and monitoring
Only after the model is trained and validated
Only during risk review by compliance teams
```
*Correct! Governance begins early and continues across the AI lifecycle to ensure responsible outcomes.*

### Coordinating roles and responsibilities
Your company is launching a cross-functional AI governance committee.

Which of the following best describes the purpose of this kind of governance structure?
```
To ensure only the IT team can approve AI tools
To centralize AI model development in the data science team
〇 To coordinate legal, compliance, tech, and business roles in AI oversight
```
*Correct! Governance structures ensure oversight is shared across key departments.*

### Match the parts to their purpose
You are reviewing your onboarding notes on the components of an AI governance system.

To check your understanding, you have been given a list of component names. Your task is to match each name to the correct definition by sorting the descriptions into the right order.
* Sort the definitions to match the order of these components:
1. Governance structure
2. Policies and principles
3. AI risk assessments

*Great job! You've correctly matched each definition to its corresponding governance component. A clear understanding of these building blocks is essential to designing responsible AI systems.*

### Governance in motion
You are helping onboard a new product manager at your company. They are familiar with AI development, but not how governance fits in.

To support their learning, you have been asked to organize four governance activities according to when they happen during the AI lifecycle.
* Sort the governance descriptions into the correct lifecycle order, from planning to post-deployment.

*Well done! Remember, governance isn't a single checklist. It's a continuous loop that helps AI systems stay compliant, ethical, and effective as they evolve. Keep it up!*

### Sharing responsibility for AI governance
You're onboarding a new colleague to your AI governance working group.

Which of the following best reflects how responsibility for AI governance is distributed in most organizations?
```
It is led exclusively by software engineers and data scientists
It is the responsibility of the legal department only
〇 It is shared across strategic, technical, legal, and business roles
```
*Correct! AI governance spans departments and requires collaboration from multiple areas of expertise.*

### Roles in AI governance
You're mapping out governance roles for your company's AI initiative.

Which function is most likely to be responsible for ensuring data quality, traceability, and documentation?
