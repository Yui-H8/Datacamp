### Hiring risk
A multinational company deploys AI to filter resumes during hiring. Based on the EU AI Act, how should this system be classified?
```
〇 High risk
Low risk
Not classified under the Act
```
*Correct — AI used in employment decisions is considered high risk.*

### Legal actions required
A startup builds an AI system used in university admissions. What legal governance actions might be required under most AI regulations?
```
〇 Documenting risk level
〇 Conducting conformity assessments
Providing a product discount
〇 Enabling human oversight
```
*Nice work! Conformity assessments may be internal or done by a third-party, depending on the regulation.*

### Risk classification
Sort the following AI systems into risk categories under the EU AI Act.

*Well sorted! Risk tiering helps regulators focus attention where it’s most needed. However, even low-risk tools may require transparency statements.*

### AI compliance in practice
Arrange the compliance actions taken by a telecom company building a high-risk AI system for fraud detection.

*Great timeline! Bonus fact: companies deploying high-risk AI in the EU must log their conformity results for future auditability.*

### Model cards
Which of the following best describes the purpose of a model card in AI governance?
```
Logging system performance over time
〇 Summarizing the intended use, risks, and performance of an AI model
Submitting audit documentation to regulators
```
*Correct — model cards communicate details like intended use and limitations.*

### Governance artifacts
Which of the following governance artifacts help ensure accountability and traceability in AI systems?
```
〇 Impact assessment
〇 Model card
〇 Audit log
UI wireframe
```
*Nice! These artifacts form the backbone of responsible AI governance. Fun fact: some regulations require that audit logs be accessible for years after deployment.*

### From training to traceability
Put the stages of traceability in the correct order, from model creation to oversight.
* Order the steps that create traceability for governance.

*Excellent! Traceability depends on linking each artifact to lifecycle actions. Traceability is increasingly demanded in third-party AI audits.*
