# Artificial Intelligence Governance2 (Free week)
---

### Understanding regulatory reach
A company is deploying an AI system that provides loan approval recommendations. Based on current global trends, which type of regulation is most likely to apply?
```
Consumer technology standards focused on app performance
〇 Risk-based governance requirements due to potential impact on individuals
Only voluntary ethical guidelines
Data retention policies unrelated to model outputs
```
*Excellent! Systems affecting life opportunities are usually high-risk under most frameworks.*

### Core elements of high-risk AI regulation
Which of the following is most commonly required by law when deploying a high-risk AI system?
```
A public press release about the AI system
A software license agreement with developers
User interface testing for accessibility
Documented risk classification and human oversight procedures
```
*That's right! Documentation and oversight are key legal requirement - good job!*

### High-risk AI in healthcare
A healthcare startup uses AI to assist in diagnosing rare diseases. Based on global regulatory trends, which framework is most likely to classify this system as "high risk"?
```
〇 EU AI Act
U.S. Executive Order on AI
China's Algorithm Guidelines
```
*You nailed it! Fun fact: The EU AI Act is the first comprehensive legal framework on AI — it even bans social scoring AI systems!*

### Governance requirements by risk
Sort the following governance requirements into the correct risk categories.
* Drag each requirement to the correct risk category.
* High-risk AI typically faces stricter governance requirements.

*Great classification! Did you know? The concept of "risk tiers" in AI governance is inspired by medical device regulation frameworks.*

### Credit scoring: compliance order
A bank in the EU is deploying a credit scoring AI. Place the required governance steps in the correct order.
* Drag and arrange the compliance steps in their correct chronological order.

*Excellent work! Bonus insight: Registration of high-risk systems under the EU AI Act will eventually feed into a public EU database for transparency.*

### In-game governance
A gaming company deploys an AI to suggest in-game purchases. What governance approach is most likely?
```
〇 Self-regulation with voluntary standards
Strict government oversight
Conformity assessment by law
Mandatory EU registration
```
*Spot on! Consumer tech is mostly self-regulated — for now. Fun fact: Some game companies have started publishing their own AI ethics guidelines!*

### Voluntary standards: match the framework
Match each voluntary AI governance standard to its primary characteristic or goal.
* Drag each standard to the correct description.

### Voluntary standards: match the framework
### Proactive versus reactive
A fintech company adopts voluntary governance tools before any regulations apply. Which of the following are potential benefits of this approach? Select all that apply.
```
〇 Improved stakeholder trust
〇 Competitive advantage
Reduced need for AI documentation
〇 Smoother adaptation to future laws
```
*Nice work! Companies that align with voluntary standards early often help shape future regulations.*

### Governance by sector
A global social media company wants to apply AI to moderate harmful content. What governance approach is most likely?
```
〇 SSelf-regulation with emerging oversight
Heavily regulated like finance
Governed under medical device law
```
*Exactly — self-regulation has historically been common in tech.*

### Hiring risk
A multinational company deploys AI to filter resumes during hiring. Based on the EU AI Act, how should this system be classified?
```
〇 High risk
Low risk
Not classified under the Act
```
*Correct — AI used in employment decisions is considered high risk.*

### Legal actions required
A startup builds an AI system used in university admissions. What legal governance actions might be required under most AI regulations?
```
〇 Documenting risk level
〇 Conducting conformity assessments
Providing a product discount
〇 Enabling human oversight
```
*Nice work! Conformity assessments may be internal or done by a third-party, depending on the regulation.*

### Risk classification
Sort the following AI systems into risk categories under the EU AI Act.

*Well sorted! Risk tiering helps regulators focus attention where it’s most needed. However, even low-risk tools may require transparency statements.*
