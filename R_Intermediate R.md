# Intermediate R
---
### Equality
* In the editor on the right, write R code to see if TRUE equals FALSE.
* Likewise, check if -6 * 14 is not equal to 17 - 101.
* Next up: comparison of character strings. Ask R whether the strings "useR" and "user" are equal.
* Finally, find out what happens if you compare logicals to numerics: are TRUE and 1 equal?
```r
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1
```
