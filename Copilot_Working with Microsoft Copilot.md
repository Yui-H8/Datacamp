### A quick event invite
You're part of the EcoGreen events team, and you need to quickly draft an event invitation email. Use Copilot with a simple, goal-only prompt to see what happens when you keep your request basic and straightforward.
1. Welcome to Microsoft Copilot   
You've been automatically logged into your own Copilot account   
Make sure to close any pop-ups that may appear   
The page should load showing a blank chat window
```
Hint
Wait for the VM to finish loading. If you see any login issues, use the Can't log in? option at the bottom-right of the VM window to recover access.
Once loaded, you should see the Copilot Chat interface ready to use.
```

2. In the Copilot prompt box, type or paste the following prompt: "Write an event invitation email."    
Submit the prompt and observe Copilot's response.

3. Review Copilot's output carefully.   
Notice how the output is generic because we only provided a goal without context, source, or expectations.
