Question: Why is learning the OpenAI API valuable for developers?    
Answer: Learning the OpenAI API is valuable for developers for several reasons:
1. **Access to Advanced AI Capabilities**: The OpenAI API provides access to powerful models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, which can perform a variety of tasks including natural language understanding, text generation, translation, summarization, and more. These capabilities can enhance applications significantly.
2. **Enhancing User Experience**: By integrating AI, developers can create more interactive and engaging user experiences. Features such as chatbots

* create a request to the Chat Completions endpoint.
```python
# Create the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Create a request to the Chat Completions endpoint
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", 
     "content": "Write a polite reply accepting an AI Engineer job offer."}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
### Specifying an OpenAI model
* Specify the gpt-4o-mini model.
* Assign the correct role in the messages list.
```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  # Specify the model

### Zero-shot prompting with reviews
* Define a prompt to classify the sentiment of the statements provided using the numbers 1 to 5 (positive to negative).
* Create a request to the Chat Completions endpoint to send this prompt to gpt-4o-mini.
```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Define a multi-line prompt to classify sentiment
prompt = """____:
1. Unbelievably good!
2. Shoes fell apart on the second use.
3. The shoes look nice, but they aren't very comfortable.
4. Can't wait to show them off!"""

# Create a request to the Chat Completions endpoint
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
  max_completion_tokens=100
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
Answer: It looks like you're categorizing reviews for a product, likely shoes. Here‚Äôs an organized representation of the feedback based on the sentiment of each point:

**Positive Reviews:**
1. Unbelievably good!
4. Can't wait to show them off!

**Negative Reviews:**
2. Shoes fell apart on the second use.
3. The shoes look nice, but they aren't very comfortable.

Feel free to let me know if you need any further analysis or assistance!

    **Overall Impression of the Shoes:**
    
    The reviews reflect a mixed experience with the shoes. Some users are thrilled with their aesthetics and quality, describing them as "unbelievably good" and expressing excitement to showcase them. However, others have faced significant issues, noting that the shoes fell apart after minimal use and that they compromise on comfort. Potential buyers should weigh the stylish design against the durability

### One-shot prompting: will it be enough?
* Add the example Love these! = 5 to the start of the prompt, and add = after each review in the prompt to indicate how the result should be formatted.
```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Add the example to the prompt
prompt = """Classify sentiment as 1-5 (negative to positive):
1. Love these! = 5
2. Unbelievably good! ____
3. Shoes fell apart on the second use. ____
4. The shoes look nice, but they aren't very comfortable. ____
5. Can't wait to show them off! ____"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], max_completion_tokens=100)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
Answer: Here are the sentiment classifications:

1. Love these! = 5
2. Unbelievably good! = 5
3. Shoes fell apart on the second use. = 1
4. The shoes look nice, but they aren't very comfortable. = 2
5. Can't wait to show them off! = 5
### Few-shot prompting: all the examples!
* Add the Comfortable, but not very pretty = 2 example to the prompt and re-run the request.
```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="<OPENAI_API_TOKEN>")

# Add the final example
prompt = """Classify sentiment as 1-5 (negative to positive):
1. Comfortable, but not very pretty = 2
2. Love these! = 5
3. Unbelievably good! = 
4. Shoes fell apart on the second use. = 
5. The shoes look nice, but they aren't very comfortable. = 
6. Can't wait to show them off! = """

response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}], max_completion_tokens=100)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Answer: Here are the sentiment classifications:

3. Unbelievably good! = 5
4. Shoes fell apart on the second use. = 1
5. The shoes look nice, but they aren't very comfortable. = 3
6. Can't wait to show them off! = 5
