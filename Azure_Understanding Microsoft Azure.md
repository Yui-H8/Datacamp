### Navigating Azure's services
In this exercise, you'll login to the portal for the very first time and start familiarizing yourself with the Azure interface.

1. Step1   
Once logged in, you'll enter the Azure homepage which provides an overview of popular services as well as recently used resources, and quick start options.

**Note**: depending on your regional settings, your Azure Portal might be displayed in another language. To quickly change the language to English, click the gear icon at the top right, select the third tab on the left (about language and region), and then change the language appropriately.

2. Step2
   Navigate to the menu bar, and go to "All services".
