### Definition of an LLM
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the technology that allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. This technology is often employed in applications such as translation services and chatbots. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of NLP that generate human-like text responses, making them integral to many areas of your life, from customer service to personalized education and entertainment.


Which of these options apply to LLMs? Select the three answers that apply.
```
〇 Designed to understand and generate language
Perform tasks such as playing chess or driving a car
〇 Trained on vast amounts of text data
〇 Perform tasks such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and text generation
```
*Well done! You have learned how LLMs are at the core of many language-based tasks, such as text translation, generation, and sentiment analysis.*
