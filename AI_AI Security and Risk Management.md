### AI risk awareness
What is one of the significant risks specifically associated with AI?
```
〇 Biased outputs
Phishing attacks
Insider threats
Data breaches
```
*Correct! AI bias is indeed a significant risk associated with AI systems, leading to unfair outcomes or discrimination.*

### Dinner at Riskland Junction
Throughout the course, we will be following Lucia Riskwalker as she embarks on a pilgrimage to get past the hype surrounding AI security and risk management.   
Her first stop is Riskland Junction, where she meets Dr. Vulnera, a social scientist etched with scars of past technological mistakes. She appreciates Lucia's willingness to go on a journey to understand better the risks associated with AI.

"The first thing that you need to know," he said, "is that AI has its own unique set of security risks."

*Congratulations on successfully navigating the complex landscape of AI security risks at Riskland Junction! You've learned that AI's unique security challenges, such as bias, data poisoning, and adversarial attacks, require vigilant attention and understanding. Your journey begins with a critical foundation in recognizing the nuanced dangers that lie ahead, preparing you for the road to come.*

### Enhancing security operations with AI
Which of the following best describes how AI can enhance security operations?
```
Replacing human security personnel entirely
Solving compliance with legal requirements
〇 Automating routine tasks
Fully automating security decision-making
```
*Perfect! AI excels at automating repetitive tasks, which frees up human analysts to concentrate on more complex, strategic issues that require human insight.*

### Risks of AI in security
What are some risks to consider when implementing AI in security? Select the four answers that are correct.
```
〇 The possibility of AI systems being manipulated through adversarial attacks
〇 AI's reliance on large datasets might inadvertently introduce bias
Ensuring AI systems are efficient and bring tangible business benefits.
〇 Challenges in ensuring AI's decisions comply with ethical standards and regulations
〇 The risk of data privacy breaches if AI systems are not properly secured
```
*Good job! Recognizing these risks is crucial for developing robust, secure AI systems. Adversarial attacks, bias from large datasets, ethical compliance, and data privacy are key considerations for safe AI implementation in security.*

### Security Catalyst Station
After a long day of walking, Lucia stops at Security Catalyst Station. She's greeted by Owen Shifter, a seasoned digital veteran. He is both anxious and excited about how AI has impacted his life.

Owen explains to Lucia that the key to understanding the path ahead is to realize how AI has changed the security landscape. He talks about which security features are more relevant in an AI-enabled environment than a traditional one. For example, AI allows you to automatize tasks and act more flexibly to threats.

*Well done on your insightful stop at Security Catalyst Station! You've discovered the significant shift AI has brought to the security domain, highlighting the evolving relevance of security features in an AI-enhanced world.*

### The importance of multiple viewpoints
Why is it important to consider different stakeholders’ perspectives in the AI security ecosystem?
```
To ensure the AI system operates at maximum efficiency
To simplify the legal compliance process
〇 To balance diverse concerns and interests, ensuring fair and effective AI security governance
```
*Correct! Balancing diverse perspectives is key to effective governance and ensures that AI security measures are ethical, responsible, and comprehensive.*

### Balancing stakeholder interests
Which stakeholders’ interests and concerns should be balanced to make informed and effective AI security decisions? Select the four correct answers below.
```
IT professionals aiming for the quickest incident response
〇 Data scientists focusing on AI model precision
〇 Legal teams concerned with privacy implications
〇 Executives considering the company's reputation
〇 Customers expecting transparency and fairness
```
*Well done! Recognizing the need to balance the interests of various stakeholders, and knowing which interests and concerns are relevant for AI security ensures that decisions are well-rounded and considerate of various perspectives.*

### Ecosystem Nexus
Lucia visits Ecosystem Nexus next to meet its diverse community. She befriends Maya Synthos, a digital princess who helps her understand various interests and build relationships.

Maya explains to Lucia that when dealing with AI systems, it is crucial to consider the interests or concerns of various stakeholders.

People, legal requirements, technologies, and processes will each have a piece of the puzzle to keep systems secure. The role of each in the broader picture must be clear.

*Congratulations on embracing the diverse perspectives at Ecosystem Nexus! You've learned the importance of considering various stakeholders' interests and responsibilities in AI systems, a crucial step for fostering secure and inclusive digital environments.*

### Common risks of AI models
Which of the following is NOT a common risk associated with developing and deploying AI models?
```
Bias in the data
〇 Chance that it could be hacked
Bias in the algorithm
Model deterioration over time
```
*Correct! Cyber threats like hacking are a risk associated with AI, but it is an external risk, not one associated with the AI model as such.*

### Continuous monitoring
Continuous monitoring is when a model is regularly observed and evaluated.

Which two answers do NOT show why this is a critical practice for managing AI models in production?
```
〇 It can keep teams focused when checking the many alerts and false positives
It allows for early detection of potential issues like model drift
〇 It simplifies the process of retraining the model with new data
```
*Well done! You were able to identify what is an advantage of continuous monitoring and what is not.*

### Model Risk Abyss
Now let's rejoin our pilgrim Lucia on her journey. Along the way, she has met fellow pilgrim Maven. As they pass a deep canyon, he tells Lucia that it is the Model Risk Abyss.

The analytical AI expert explains the challenges posed over the lifecycle of AI models. Some risks can arise during the development of models and others appear over time when models are deployed.

*Kudos for crossing the Model Risk Abyss! You've tackled the intricacies of model risks, understanding that challenges can arise both during development and post-deployment. This knowledge helps you gain the vigilance needed to anticipate and mitigate risks throughout the AI lifecycle.*

### Types of external risks
Malicious actors can exploit AI systems through various external threats. Which three of the following are potential external risks to AI systems?
```
〇 Data poisoning
〇 Adversarial attacks
System outages
〇 Model inversion
```
*Well done! You've selected three of the ways that external actors can attempt to compromise AI systems.*
