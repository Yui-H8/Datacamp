# Data Science for Business
---
**Description**

What is data science and how can you use it to strengthen your organization? This course will teach you about the skills you need on your data team, and how you can structure that team to meet your organization's needs. Data is everywhere! This course will provide you with an understanding of data sources your company can use and how to store that data. You'll also discover ways to analyze and visualize your data through dashboards and A/B tests. To wrap up the course, we'll discuss exciting topics in machine learning, including clustering, time series prediction, natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and explainable AI! Along the way, you'll learn about a variety of real-world applications of data science and gain a better understanding of these concepts through practical exercises.

### Customer Segmentation Workflow
Stephanie manages a data science team at a subscription dog food company. Her team has been asked to investigate customer churn.
* Order the steps in a logical fashion.

*Well done! You've organized these tasks according to the data science workflow: data collection comes first, followed by exploration and visualization, then experimentation and prediction.*

### Building a customer service chatbot
Ritesh and his data team are working on a customer service chatbot. They will use transcripts from over 300,000 customer service interactions to train a chatbot to answer customer questions.
* Classify each action that Ritesh's team will take as either Data Collection, Exploration and Visualization, or Experimentation and Prediction.

*Great job! Ritesh's team should start by gathering customer information and timestamps for each transcript. They should then visualize the number of conversations and understand when they happen each day. Finally, they can classify each question and predict a possible response using a Markov model.*

### Improving OKRs
OKR stands for Objective/Key Result. An Objective is a goal, and a Key Result is a numerical measure of that goal.

Justina's company creates OKRs every quarter to set goals and track progress. Her team put together the Data Science OKRs slide on the right. She completed the first two OKRs, but is still working on OKR 3. She wants to select a Key Result for OKR 3 from the list below.

Which of the following Key Results would be an example of "Predicting and Experimenting with Data", the third step in the data science workflow?
```
〇 Use a linear regression to estimate a user's Net Promoter Score (NPS) based on their previous purchases, social media interactions, and cohort.
Collect data on which users are most active on the website.
Create a dashboard with a histogram showing the number of users with different levels of engagement.
```
*Yes, training a linear regression is an example of “Predicting and Experimenting with Data”.*

### Assigning data science projects
Laura manages three teams, each with a different specialty:
* Traditional Machine Learning
* Internet of Things
* Deep Learning
  
Laura has a several tasks that she's hoping to achieve this quarter. To get started, she needs to assign each task to the appropriate team.
* Match each task to the team that is best suited to complete it.

*Great job! Text summary and image classification are generally deep learning problems. Anything involving a physical device is probably an IoT problem. All other problems can probably be solved by traditional machine learning.*

### Investment research
Greg is an investment analyst. He's been asked to review a new start-up that uses easy-to-install vibration sensors to measure the amount of traffic on a bridge or highway.

His boss has asked him to do some background research and decide what category this start-up belongs in.
```
Traditional machine learning
Deep learning
〇 Internet of things
Natural language processing
```
*Correct! A vibration sensing device is an example of the Internet of Things, also known as IoT.*

### Interpreting a team sprint
Jake is helping organize his team's sprint planning. Sprint planning is when a technical team plans which tasks they will focus on in the coming week. Based on the tasks listed in the sprint planning board, which model of team is Jake working with?
```
〇 Hybrid
Embedded
Isolated
```
*Yes, this team is a hybrid model! Notice how some of these tasks involve design, Javascript, or C++. This means that the team contains non-data members. Also notice that they need to coordinate with a “central data team”. This suggests a hybrid model.*

### Editing a job posting
Quyen is looking to expand her team by hiring a Data Analyst. This analyst will be performing ad hoc analyses and building dashboards to track company-wide goals.

Quyen is working on a job description for a job board. She's almost done writing the Basic Qualifications section. Which of the following should she add?
```
〇 Expert user of Excel or Google Sheets, including VLOOKUP and pivot tables
Some experience with Deep Learning and neural nets
Basic proficiency in either Java, Scala, or Python for database operations
```
*Yes, spreadsheet tools are important for data analysts. They allow analysts to quickly analyze data and share their results with less data-savvy coworkers.*

### Matching skills to jobs
Johan manages a Data Science team, and is looking to post some new job listings for a Data Engineer and a Machine Learning Scientist. Help Johan decide which skill requirements belong with each job.
* Drag each requirement into the correct resume.

*Great job! Data engineers need to know SQL and Java. Although data engineers also need to know Python, they use it for data cleaning, not for prediction and modeling.*

### Classifying data tasks
Alma is leading sprint planning this week. Sprint planning is when a technical team assigns tasks for the coming week and sets priorities. Alma's team is composed of a Data Engineer, a Data Analyst, and a Machine Learning Scientist.
* Assign each task to the correct job title.
