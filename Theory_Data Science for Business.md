# Data Science for Business
---
**Description**

What is data science and how can you use it to strengthen your organization? This course will teach you about the skills you need on your data team, and how you can structure that team to meet your organization's needs. Data is everywhere! This course will provide you with an understanding of data sources your company can use and how to store that data. You'll also discover ways to analyze and visualize your data through dashboards and A/B tests. To wrap up the course, we'll discuss exciting topics in machine learning, including clustering, time series prediction, natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and explainable AI! Along the way, you'll learn about a variety of real-world applications of data science and gain a better understanding of these concepts through practical exercises.

### Customer Segmentation Workflow
Stephanie manages a data science team at a subscription dog food company. Her team has been asked to investigate customer churn.
* Order the steps in a logical fashion.

*Well done! You've organized these tasks according to the data science workflow: data collection comes first, followed by exploration and visualization, then experimentation and prediction.*

### Building a customer service chatbot
Ritesh and his data team are working on a customer service chatbot. They will use transcripts from over 300,000 customer service interactions to train a chatbot to answer customer questions.
* Classify each action that Ritesh's team will take as either Data Collection, Exploration and Visualization, or Experimentation and Prediction.

*Great job! Ritesh's team should start by gathering customer information and timestamps for each transcript. They should then visualize the number of conversations and understand when they happen each day. Finally, they can classify each question and predict a possible response using a Markov model.*

### Improving OKRs
OKR stands for Objective/Key Result. An Objective is a goal, and a Key Result is a numerical measure of that goal.

Justina's company creates OKRs every quarter to set goals and track progress. Her team put together the Data Science OKRs slide on the right. She completed the first two OKRs, but is still working on OKR 3. She wants to select a Key Result for OKR 3 from the list below.

Which of the following Key Results would be an example of "Predicting and Experimenting with Data", the third step in the data science workflow?
```
〇 Use a linear regression to estimate a user's Net Promoter Score (NPS) based on their previous purchases, social media interactions, and cohort.
Collect data on which users are most active on the website.
Create a dashboard with a histogram showing the number of users with different levels of engagement.
```
*Yes, training a linear regression is an example of “Predicting and Experimenting with Data”.*

### Assigning data science projects
Laura manages three teams, each with a different specialty:
* Traditional Machine Learning
* Internet of Things
* Deep Learning
  
Laura has a several tasks that she's hoping to achieve this quarter. To get started, she needs to assign each task to the appropriate team.
* Match each task to the team that is best suited to complete it.

*Great job! Text summary and image classification are generally deep learning problems. Anything involving a physical device is probably an IoT problem. All other problems can probably be solved by traditional machine learning.*
