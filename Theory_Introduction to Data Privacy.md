### Preach shopping scenario
Poh Ching wants to do some online holiday shopping. She goes to her favorite online store to buy some climbing gear. However, when Poh Ching logs on to the site, she is redirected to a new privacy policy page.

The new page is long and confusing. She skims the page and can understand that the website will collect information about her shopping experience to improve future shopping recommendations. At the end of the page, she is asked if she agrees to all of the new changes.

Based on what you have learned, what is wrong with the online store's privacy policy?
```
It is not easy to understand for users.
It is unclear how the company plans to use Poh Ching's data, for example, if they will share it with 3rd party companies.
It is not clear if Poh Ching can change her information.
It is unclear if Poh Ching will be alerted if the store misuses her information.

### Understanding privacy responsibilities
Privacy has different meanings and significance to different groups. You will be tasked with matching different personas (individual, company, regulator) with their responsibilities.

Manuel has downloaded a new app from his favorite fast food chain, PizzaRUs. When he logs into the app for the first time, PizzaRUs asks him to agree to share his location and agree to the company's privacy policy. In the privacy policy, PizzaRUs mentions that they comply with several privacy laws. After reviewing the privacy policy, Manuel sets up his account and orders a pizza.

```
*Perfect! You successfully broke down and understood the key components of the CIA Triad!*

### CIA Triad concept match
The CIA Triad contains some core security concepts and principles. Understanding the difference between the different acronyms (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) can help engineers and program managers more effectively build out programs and identify additional controls, processes, or policies that need to be implemented.

*Congrats! You did a great job. You have a solid understanding of the CIA model and a few security controls related to the triad.*

### Security models three truths and a lie

### Privacy and security incident
We have learned that malicious actors may try to access, alter, or exploit data. This may result in a privacy incident, a security incident, or sometimes both. It's important to think about the potential ramifications of a data breach. It's not just about figuring out how it happened but also why and when it happened. It's also important to think about who may have been impacted by the breach.

In this exercise, please select the scenario that constitutes both a privacy and a security breach.
```
〇 A hacker accesses and exports healthcare records from a local hospital. The records contain patient information, including names, addresses, and dates of birth.
An engineer accidentally makes a company's internal training available to the public; the training does not contain any images or references to people.
A hacker group steals a company's patented technology and sells it to a competitor.
A company posts customer testimonials on its website; the customers have already signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and consent forms, which approve the use of their testimonials.
```
*Perfect, you understand the overlap between security and privacy. A data breach is extra knarly when it results in both a security compromise and a privacy compromise!*

### Analyzing key themes within Security and Privacy
Security and Privacy are often viewed as being mutually exclusive. However, as we've learned, there are significant areas of overlap between security and privacy. Security controls are the basis of a strong privacy program.

It is important that you can identify the similarities and differences between security and privacy.
* In this exercise, you will be creating a Venn Diagram. The exercise aims to match the appropriate terms and concepts with the correct category.
