# AWS Concepts

### Navigating the AWS console
* In this exercise, you'll login to the AWS Management Console and familiarize yourself with the interface. Additionally, you'll learn how to search for and find key services such as EC2.    
*Note: The sandboxes in this course have been configured to achieve the goals within the exercises therefore some non-related services may be restricted.*
1. Once logged in, you'll enter the AWS Management Console where you will see several different widgets including recently visited services, applications in the current region, getting started information, and much more.
2. This will open up the EC2 dashboard that includes various widgets such as Resources, Instance alarms and more.
3. Under the Resources widget, there are multiple services available. Which service is not included in the list?    
    You won't find billing information on the EC2 dashboard, instead that is located under Billing and Cost Management.
