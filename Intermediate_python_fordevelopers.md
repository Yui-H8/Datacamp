### Get some assistance   
Not only does Python offer a range of built-in functions, but this even includes a way to find out more about data types, structures, and other functions.
```python
# Find out more about len()
print(help(len))

# Help on built-in function len in module builtins:
# len(obj, /)
#    Return the number of items in a container.
# None
```
# Use help() on the int data type.
```Python

```
