# Introduction to AI for Work

First, what's your current role or the role you're working toward, and in what industry or field?   
This helps me choose examples and applications that are most relevant to your work.   
Thanks for sharing that, Yui! So you're working in AI ethics—that's a fascinating and increasingly important field.   
Second question: What AI tools are you currently using in your work, or are you just getting started?   
This helps me understand your current experience level and tailor the examples accordingly.


Thanks for sharing this information, Yui. It'll help me choose relevant examples from AI ethics and build on your existing GPT experience throughout the course.

Imagine you're working on an AI ethics review and need to consolidate information from 15 research papers on algorithmic bias. Each paper presents findings differently—some use tables, others use narrative descriptions, and they're all organized uniquely.

The old way? You'd spend hours manually extracting key data points—study methodology, dataset size, bias metrics, mitigation strategies, and findings—then copy-pasting everything into a spreadsheet for comparison.

Now, let's look at how this can be done with AI.

Here's how AI transforms this task:

Upload the 15 research papers to AI (ensuring they're appropriate per your organization's policies) and specify the fields to extract: study methodology, dataset size, bias metrics, mitigation strategies, and key findings
AI reads each paper and pulls the relevant data points
AI organizes everything into a clean spreadsheet format, making comparison and analysis straightforward
Review the consolidated data against the original papers to confirm accuracy
This eliminates hours of manual work, reduces copy-paste errors, and lets you focus on the actual ethics analysis rather than data gathering. And this is just one example of how AI can help.

In this course, we'll learn how to work with AI to save time and boost productivity, as well as how to work with AI safely—including critical considerations around data privacy.

Clear so far?

That's a good start! You're right that AI can calculate faster and automate tasks. Let me build on that.

Think about tasks that normally require human thinking—like understanding what someone is saying, recognizing a face in a photo, or deciding the fastest route somewhere.

Artificial intelligence is technology that allows computers to do these kinds of tasks that would normally require human intelligence.

So it's not just about speed or automation—it's about enabling computers to handle tasks that involve understanding, reasoning, and decision-making, things that traditionally only humans could do.
